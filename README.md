# AM2315 Encased I2C Temperature/Humidity Sensor

Simple asyncronous node.js library for reading the AM2315 I2C via Raspberry Pi


## Example

`npm install AM2315`


```
var sensor = require('AM2315');

// Get the current Temp and Humidity
sensor.read(function(err, data){
	if(err) console.error(err);
	else console.log("Temperature: %d F   Humidity: %d\%", data[0], data[1]);
});
```

Probably requires running node under `sudo` for I2C permissions, unless you've used [Wiring Pi's gpio utility](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/the-gpio-utility/) or otherwise adjusted device permissions.

## API

### spi.read(cb(err, data){})

Collects the current Temerature and Humidity from the AM2315 via I2C on the Raspberry Pi and returns them as an array (data[temp, humidity]) with your callback.




## Compatibility Note

This library is subject to change.
